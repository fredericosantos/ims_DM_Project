# Frederico:
# I can't see how we can use the percentage of how structures/housing are in the neighborhood;
# This would work to create a scale of richness of the neighborhood, which we already have sometimes
# We could use a classifier to measure agaisnt WEALTH2/WEALTH1 with this info and predict the missing WEALTH2/WEALTH1
# But I think this would be a project by itself, very much outside the scope of this project
# I will see if I can do this just for fun
