gitBrainstorming

Frederico

Initial thoughts on the project: - Drop rows where MAILCODE == B, SOLP3
== 0, SOLHI == 0; - Group by Age and Gender - Group by State; plot a lot
of things into states - Group by ZIP code; plot a lot of things into
counties

Right now I am exploring some columns of dataset in svitlana_eda.ipynb,
where will add some thoughts about columns to choose or drop as well, in
a process - so I do not copy this information to here

                                The following lists the promotion codes and their
                                respective field names (where XXXX refers to ADATE, RFA,
                                RDATE and RAMNT.)

                                1st 2 bytes of the code refers to the year of the
                                mailing while 3rd and 4th bytes refer to the
                                following promotion codes/types:
    
                                LL mailings had labels only
                                WL mailings had labels only
                                CC mailings are calendars with stickers but do
                                   not have labels
                                FS mailings are blank cards that fold into
                                   thirds with labels
                                NK mailings are blank cards with labels
                                SK mailings are blank cards with labels
                                TK mailings have thank you printed on the
                                   outside with labels
                                GK mailings are general greeting cards (an
                                   assortment of birthday, sympathy, blank, & get
                                   well) with labels
                                XK mailings are Christmas cards with labels
                                X1 mailings have labels and a notepad
                                G1 mailings have labels and a notepad
    
                                This information could certainly be used to calculate
                                several summary variables that count the number of
                                occurrences of various types of promotions received
                                in the most recent 12-36 months, etc.
    
                                RFA (RECENCY/FREQUENCY/AMOUNT)
                                ------------------------------
    
                                The RFA (recency/frequency/amount) status of the
                                donors (as of the promotion dates) is included in the
                                RFA fields.
    
                                The (current) concatenated version is a nominal
                                or symbolic field. The individual bytes could
                                separately be used as fields and refer to the
                                following:
    
                                First Byte of code is concerned with RECENCY
                                based on Date of the last Gift
    
                                F=FIRST TIME DONOR Anyone who has made their
                                  first donation in the last 6 months and has
                                  made just one donation.
    
                                N=NEW DONOR Anyone who has made their first
                                  donation in the last 12 months and is not a
                                  First time donor.  This is everyone who made
                                  their first donation 7-12 months ago, or
                                  people who made their first donation between
                                  0-6 months ago and have made 2 or more
                                  donations.
    
                                A=ACTIVE DONOR Anyone who made their first
                                  donation more than 12 months ago and has made
                                  a donation in the last 12 months.
    
                                L=LAPSING DONOR A previous donor who made their
                                  last donation between 13-24 months ago.
    
                                I=INACTIVE DONOR A previous donor who has not
                                  made a donation in the last 24 months.  It is
                                  people who made a donation 25+ months ago.
    
                                S=STAR DONOR STAR Donors are individuals who
                                  have given to 3 consecutive card mailings.
    
    
                                Second Byte of code is concerned with FREQUENCY
                                based on the period of recency.  The period of
                                recency for all groups except L and I is the
                                last 12 months.  For L it is 13-24 months ago,
                                and for I it is 25-36 months ago.  There are
                                four valid frequency codes.
    
                                1=One gift in the period of recency
                                2=Two gift in the period of recency
                                3=Three gifts in the period of recency
                                4=Four or more gifts in the period of recency
    
                                Third byte of the code is the Amount of the last
                                gift.

# Frederico:
# Every donor is Lapsing

# Svitlana: yes, for the moment of June 2017 (as I understand it is the last moment, "today" for this dataset,
# last mailing was 17NK) - all donors in RFA_2 are lapsed.
# Maybe we can use information from 2016 - RFA_3 to have some additional info about our donors previous
# year behavior? I explained near cell with NGIFTALL and CARDGIFT - why, all discussable of course :-)
# I've seen some projects online using this column splitting it to RFA_3R, RFA_3F, RFA_3A with RAMNT_3 together
# but it's for discussion

# Svitlana:
# RAMNTALL - Dollar amount of lifetime gifts to date

# Frederico:
# What about an average of lifetime gifts per year and cluster around values?
# NGIFTALL and CARDGIFT can give us a sense of how effective card promotions are

# Svitlana: CARDGIFT - describes response to card promotions mailed,
# as I understand - NK SK TK GK XK - card promotions
# NGIFTALL - shows all gifts from donors not only this "sending cards - receiving gifts" scheme,
# last fours 17NK (RFA_2) and 16NK (RFA_3), 16TK, 16SK were card promotions
# so have some questions about leaving both - NGIFTALL vs. CARDGIFT Pearson 91.46% Spearman 92.34%
# I would drop NGIFTALL

# There is also could not be any responce from RFA_2 campain as I understand
# because RFA_2 was done (ADATE_2 = 2017-06-01)
# and the last LASTDATE (Date associated with the most recent gift) is 2017-02-01
# so technicallly these are all responces to the all campains except last one RFA_2 (as I understand)
